You have to fill description.md, main-functionnalities.md and my-role.md for the project I tell you to.

Here some indication :

- All the project are in content/projects.
- Use the github mcp to get more info, files and commits
- Read the meta.json and carousel.json to have more info
- from the date in meta.json you can know I learn code from 2021 to july 2023, I start freelancing in august 2023 and start my studies in september 2023
- avoid to invent anything, ask me instead
- you can take as example the project winalia

Here some rules :

- description.md and my-role.md must be paragraph (no list)
- main-functionnalities.md must be bullet points made with emoji
- no need to precise technologies their already are in the page
- for the part my role, fill it only if I don't own all the commit. If you have to fill it the commit name from me may help you
