In my apprenticeship, I contribute to the development and maintenance of web applications for public organizations and private companies. I work on projects combining an Angular front end with a Java Spring back end, integrating diverse business features mainly related to document management. My role also includes using version control (Git/Gerrit), task management (Redmine), and deployment tools (Jenkins), while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable and user-oriented solutions.
