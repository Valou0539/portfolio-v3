As a freelance front-end developer, I design, develop, and maintain websites and web applications for various clients, sometimes creating the designs myself and frequently working on the back end to understand the system or implement small features. I manage the entire front-end workflow, from prototyping and UI implementation to performance optimization, while collaborating directly with clients to translate their needs into effective digital solutions.
