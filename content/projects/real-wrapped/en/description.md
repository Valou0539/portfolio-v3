Real Wrapped was born from a limitation of Spotify Wrapped: rankings are based on the number of plays, not on the actual time spent listening. This bias disadvantages long tracks and artists who favor extended formats.

The application directly leverages listening history to generate statistics based on **real listening time**. The result is a more accurate representation of listening habits, where long tracks and their artists finally get the recognition they deserve.
