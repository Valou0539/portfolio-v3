Purstream is a streaming website for movies and TV series. We took a template provided by the client and implemented new features and fixed many bugs before its launch. The template previously offered a login only via discord and stored its own movie and series data. The first features to implement were a classic and secure login and the use of the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to retrieve movie and series data.
