In this project, we were two developers. My role was to develop the front-end, but wanting to diversify, I also worked on several back-end features. For example, I implemented the retrieval of TV series episodes and movies via the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API, modifying the fetched data so that the front-end template code wouldnâ€™t need any changes. I also developed new functionalities, such as allowing users to change their password through the admin panel.

On the front-end side, I developed almost all the requested new features and fixed the majority of the bugs. This includes email registration with profile picture, download functionality, multi-source support in the player, IPTV integration, redesigning carousels to allow scrolling by clicking and dragging, and more.
