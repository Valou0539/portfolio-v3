Cybercave is the project of the first client of Dev Boost, my self-employed business launched with a friend. Cybercave was a store located in Dole, in the Jura. It offered products derived from pop culture and wanted to set up a website to develop its activity. The site, in addition to the landing page, allowed customers to see the products available, reserve them, and consult topics and react on a forum.
