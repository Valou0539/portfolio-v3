I was mainly responsible for the front-end development of Wantag. I designed and implemented the integrated widget, the landing page, and the entire front-end of the application, ensuring a modern and seamless user experience. In addition, I also contributed to the back-end by developing specific features such as the AI context management for projects, enabling better personalization and progressive enrichment of AI-assisted tickets.
