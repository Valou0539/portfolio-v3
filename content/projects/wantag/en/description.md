Wantag is my first SaaS, developed together with my friend [Evan](https://evan-perreau.fr) and brought up to the alpha stage without the payment interface. It is a ticket management solution designed for web developers and service companies. It allows easy integration of a widget directly into an application through a simple script tag. This widget enables clients to create AI-assisted tickets, making communication smoother and need qualification more accurate. The tickets are then centralized in the Wantag WebApp, where managers can process them, collaborate with their teams, manage related projects, and track working time. With its system of invitations, roles, and permissions, Wantag promotes a structured and secure organization between managers, collaborators, and clients.
