Code With Me is a website developed as part of a SAÃ‰ (Learning and Assessment Situation) during my BUT degree. This project involved creating a website based on a fake client request formulated by a professor. The objective was to develop a mockup and then the complete site while respecting the accessibility standards covered in class. The site presents a collaborative platform for developers, with a modern and accessible interface. This project allowed me to deepen my front-end web development skills while concretely applying accessibility principles and web development best practices.
